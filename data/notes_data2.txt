Guiying went back to old records broken in to 60-sec chunks, most of which look like 1 channel present, high rate data, some records have CFTR blocker glibenclamide

The files here are from one recording of WT-CFTR in the absence and presence of 50 micromolar glibenclamide.

Glibenclamide is common, goes into cytoplasmic entrance into channel pore, kinetics are totally different than those associated with channel closure; shows difference between pore and gating dynamics. Action is voltage dependent. Two different ways it can enter (polar, charged), entering one way has few msec blocking times, entering the other yields 10+ msec blocking times.
